                Lulu. I have had her since June of 2020 when I adopted
                her from a friend and college classmate who moved out of 
                state. Her birthday is July 10th and she is currently 6
                years old. She's not very playful or cuddly and she yells
                a lot, but she is still an amazing cat!
